# UNC Tester
This repository is a fork of **NamingStandard's** UNC tester. I upgraded it's functionality.
**Currently is out of 107.**

I am working on adding more functions to this UNC tester, and I update it when I can and when I'm not busy.

## How to load?
It's very easy to load, just follow these steps below!
1. Load up your executor (can be any Roblox executor (e.g. Solara, Xeno, Volcano, etc))
2. Inject into Roblox and paste this in:

`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hw630590/unc-tester/refs/heads/main/unc.lua"))()`

3. Click 'Execute' or 'Run' on your executor.
